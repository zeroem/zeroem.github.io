        <h1>Who You're Getting</h1>
        <p>In a phrase, a software generalist. I've made gone out of my way to have at least a rudimentary understanding all aspects of software delivery. Throughout my career I've been involved with everything from prototyping a new project to sscaling and established one, leading a team of developers to managing a project, introducing automation and cleaning up existing work. My definition of "done" doesn't stop at committing to version control or all test suites passing, nothing less than running in production is acceptable.</p>

        <p>At a more abstract level I'm a tinkerer, an experimenter. Driven by a constant desire for improvement, I'm always on the lookout for a better way. I hate "no", I hate "that's just the way it is", I hate "can't". To me, "good enough" is rarely ever good enough. It's gotta be good or better. It doesn't have to be perfect; it doesn't have to be ideal; it just needs to be good.</p>

        <p>These attitudes are not limited to some subset of my interests, they're pervasive in everything that I do. From the software I'm working on, to the development practices being used, to the business itself, I immerse myself in it. I look at it from inside and out. Every rough patch, every blemish, every inefficiency gets interrogated, "how could this be better?"</p>
